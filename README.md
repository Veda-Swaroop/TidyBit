## 📝 Description: TidyBit is a simple handy tool that can organize messy collection of files and move them to a chosen folder. 

## 📖 Introduction

Our computers often become cluttered with files scattered across Downloads, Desktop, or external drives. Manually sorting them is tedious and time‑consuming. **TidyBit** was built to solve this problem with a clean, beginner‑friendly interface.

This lightweight Python tool helps you organize files in just four simple steps:
1. **Validation** – Check source and target folder paths  
2. **Fetch Files** – Display files from the source folder  
3. **Organize Files** – Categorize files by extension (documents, images, videos, code, etc.)  
4. **Move Files** – Create subfolders and move files accordingly  

With its simple GUI and clear logbox feedback, TidyBit makes file organization effortless and efficient.


## ✨ Features
- Organizes files by category (documents, images, videos, audio, code, archives, etc.)
- Simple GUI with logbox feedback
- Step-by-step workflow:
  1. Validation
  2. Fetching Files
  3. Organizing Files
  4. Moving Files
- Supports most common file extensions
- Clear error handling and user messages

## ⚙️ Installation (Running from Source)
If you are a developer or want to run the Python script directly:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python project.py

## 🚀 Usage

Using **TidyBit** is straightforward. The interface guides you through four clear steps:

1. **Select Folders**  
   - Choose a **source folder** (where cluttered files are located).  
   - Choose a **target folder** (where organized files will be moved).  

2. **Validate Paths**  
   - Click **Start** to confirm both folder paths.  
   - If there are issues, TidyBit alerts you with a message window.  

3. **Fetch Files**  
   - Display all files from the source folder in the logbox.  
   - Verify the list before proceeding.  

4. **Organize & Move**  
   - Files are categorized by extension (documents, images, videos, audio, code, archives, etc.).  
   - Subfolders are created in the target directory.  
   - Files are moved into their respective categories with clear logbox feedback.  

📷 The screenshots above illustrate each step in action.


## 🛠️ Roadmap

TidyBit is just getting started! Here are some planned improvements and future directions:

- [ ] **Cross‑platform support** – Extend compatibility to Linux and macOS  
- [ ] **Enhanced error handling** – More detailed logs and clearer user feedback  
- [ ] **Expanded file categories** – Support additional extensions and niche file types
